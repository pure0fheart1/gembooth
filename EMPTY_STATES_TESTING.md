## üîß Debugging Tips

### Empty State Not Appearing
```javascript
// Check in browser console:
console.log('videoActive:', videoActive)
console.log('photos.length:', photos.length)
console.log('activeMode:', activeMode)
console.log('emptyStateType:', getEmptyStateType(videoActive, activeMode, photos))
```

### Animations Not Running
```javascript
// Check CSS is loaded:
const styles = getComputedStyle(document.querySelector('.emptyState'))
console.log('Animation:', styles.animation)
console.log('Transform:', styles.transform)
```

### State Stuck
```javascript
// Force state reset:
useStore.setState({ photos: [] })
setPhotoError(null)
```
