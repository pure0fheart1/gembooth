## API Configuration

Both features use the same hardcoded Gemini API key:
```javascript
const ai = new GoogleGenAI({
  apiKey: 'AIzaSyBjosltDAxf1XQXoxO7ogY6BXO3UmD191A'
});
```

**Models Used:**
- Co-Drawing: `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (user selectable)
- Past Forward: `gemini-2.5-flash-image` (fixed)

## Design System Adherence

Both features follow Gembooth's established patterns:

### Colors:
- Background: `#000` (solid black)
- Frosted glass: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.05)` + `backdrop-filter: blur(10px)`
- Borders: `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.1)`
- Text: `#fff` (primary), `rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.7)` (secondary)
- Accent: `linear-gradient(135deg, #667eea 0%, #764ba2 100%)`

### Spacing:
- Page padding-top: `80px` (accounts for fixed nav)
- Section gaps: `2rem` (desktop), `1rem` (mobile)
- Component padding: `2rem` (desktop), `1rem` (mobile)

### Typography:
- Headings: 3rem → 2rem (responsive)
- Body: 1.125rem → 1rem
- Captions: 0.875rem

### Responsive Breakpoints:
- Mobile: `max-width: 768px`
- Tablet: `max-width: 1024px`

## Storage Buckets

Uses existing `user-photos` bucket with new paths:

**Co-Drawing Storage:**
```
user-photos/
└── {user_id}/
    └── codrawings/
        └── {drawing_id}.png
```

**Past Forward Storage:**
```
user-photos/
└── {user_id}/
    └── pastforward/
        └── {image_id}.jpg
```

## Dependencies

### Installed:
```bash
npm install lucide-react
```

### Already Available:
- @google/genai
- react-router-dom
- @supabase/supabase-js
