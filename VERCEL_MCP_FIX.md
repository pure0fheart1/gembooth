# Vercel MCP Server Connection Fix

## Problem Summary

The Vercel MCP server was not connecting because:
1. **Missing Configuration**: No Vercel MCP server was configured in Claude Desktop's global configuration
2. **Wrong Configuration Location**: Previously attempted to configure in `.claude.json` (project-level) instead of `claude_desktop_config.json` (global)
3. **Incorrect Package**: May have been trying to use a non-existent or incorrect package name

## Solution Applied

### 1. Installed the Correct Package
Using `@mistertk/vercel-mcp` - a comprehensive MCP server with 114+ tools for Vercel platform management.

### 2. Added Configuration to Claude Desktop
**File**: `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

**Configuration Added**:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vercel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": [
        "-y",
        "@mistertk/vercel-mcp",
        "VERCEL_API_KEY=rWv7w6FlN9RXDSuHuMP5yjmr"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### 3. Why This Works
- **npx**: Automatically downloads and runs the package without global installation
- **-y flag**: Auto-accepts the prompt to install the package
- **API Key as Argument**: The package expects `VERCEL_API_KEY=<key>` as a command-line argument
- **Global Configuration**: Claude Desktop reads MCP servers from its global config file

## Verification Steps

The configuration has been tested and confirmed working:
1. Package downloads successfully via npx
2. Server starts without errors
3. API key is correctly passed as argument

## Next Steps

**To activate the Vercel MCP server:**
1. **Close Claude Desktop completely** (if running)
2. **Restart Claude Desktop**
3. The Vercel MCP server will initialize automatically
4. You should see Vercel-related tools available in Claude Desktop

## Available Vercel Tools

Once connected, you'll have access to 114+ tools including:
- Deployment management
- Project creation and configuration
- Environment variable management
- Domain and DNS configuration
- Team operations
- Security settings
- Monitoring and analytics
- And much more

## Troubleshooting

If the connection still fails after restart:

1. **Check the logs**: Look at Claude Desktop's logs for error messages
2. **Verify API Key**: Ensure your Vercel API token is valid and has appropriate permissions
3. **Test manually**: Run this command to test the server:
   ```bash
   npx -y @mistertk/vercel-mcp VERCEL_API_KEY=rWv7w6FlN9RXDSuHuMP5yjmr
   ```
4. **Check network**: Ensure you have internet access for npx to download the package

## Alternative Configuration (Using Environment Variable)

If you prefer to store the API key separately, you can use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vercel": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@mistertk/vercel-mcp"],
      "env": {
        "VERCEL_API_KEY": "rWv7w6FlN9RXDSuHuMP5yjmr"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

However, the current configuration (API key as argument) is confirmed to work with this package.

## Key Takeaways

1. **MCP Server Location**: Claude Code uses `.claude.json` (project-level), Claude Desktop uses `claude_desktop_config.json` (global)
2. **Package Selection**: Always check the package documentation for the correct configuration format
3. **Restart Required**: Claude Desktop must be restarted to pick up new MCP server configurations
4. **Test First**: Use npx manually to verify the package works before adding to configuration

## Status

✅ Configuration successfully added
✅ Server verified working
⏳ Requires Claude Desktop restart to activate
